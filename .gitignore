# Other specific .env files if any (though covered by .env.*)
# Example: client/.env, node_backend/.env (if they were still per-service)
# For this project, .env files are now at the root.
# The per-service .env files (e.g. client/.env) are no longer the primary ones used by docker-compose
# but might be created by users for other purposes, so ignoring them generally is fine.
